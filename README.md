# Presentations 2016


Here we have code examples used for a series of presentations designed for junior and intermediate programmers.

The goal for these presentations is to familiarize programmers with low level concepts and things that go on "under the hood" of various systems.

These were created in collaboration with Radu Angelescu - https://github.com/raduangelescu .

Soon I will also add the slides[now they are WIP :)].
